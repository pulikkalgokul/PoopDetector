## Features

Swift Mocking is Swift 6 compatible, fully concurrency-safe, and generates conditionally compiled mocks that can handle:
- Any access level
- Associated types, including primary associated types
- Actor conformance
- Generic `where` clauses 
- Initializers
- Static members
- Instance members 
- Read-only properties, including those with getters marked with `async`, `throws`, `mutating`, etc.
- Read-write properties
- Mutating methods
- Async methods
- Throwing methods
- Generic methods
- Method overloads
- Attributed types (`inout`, `consuming`, `sending`, etc.)
- Variadic parameters
